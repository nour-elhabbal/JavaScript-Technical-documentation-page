          - JavaScript is a cross-platform, object-oriented scripting language. It is a small and
          lightweight language. Inside a host environment (for example, a web browser), JavaScript
          can be connected to the objects of its environment to provide programmatic control over
          them.
        </div>

        <div class="p-block">
          - JavaScript contains a standard library of objects, such as Array, Date, and Math, and a
          core set of language elements such as operators, control structures, and statements. Core
          JavaScript can be extended for a variety of purposes by supplementing it with additional
          objects; for example:
          <ul>
            <li>
              - Client-side JavaScript extends the core language by supplying objects to control a
              browser and its Document Object Model (DOM). For example, client-side extensions allow
              an application to place elements on an HTML form and respond to user events such as
              mouse clicks, form input, and page navigation.
            </li>

            <li>
              - Server-side JavaScript extends the core language by supplying objects relevant to
              running JavaScript on a server. For example, server-side extensions allow an
              application to communicate with a database, provide continuity of information from one
              invocation to another of the application, or perform file manipulations on a server.
            </li>

        <div class="p-block">
          - JavaScript and Java are similar in some ways but fundamentally different in some others.
          The JavaScript language resembles Java but does not have Java's static typing and strong
          type checking. JavaScript follows most Java expression syntax, naming conventions and
          basic control-flow constructs which was the reason why it was renamed from LiveScript to
          JavaScript.
        </div>

        <div class="p-block">
          - In contrast to Java's compile-time system of classes built by declarations, JavaScript
          supports a runtime system based on a small number of data types representing numeric,
          Boolean, and string values. JavaScript has a prototype-based object model instead of the
          more common class-based object model. The prototype-based model provides dynamic
          inheritance; that is, what is inherited can vary for individual objects. JavaScript also
          supports functions without any special declarative requirements. Functions can be
          properties of objects, executing as loosely typed methods.
        </div>

        <div class="p-block">
          - JavaScript is a very free-form language compared to Java. You do not have to declare all
          variables, classes, and methods. You do not have to be concerned with whether methods are
          public, private, or protected, and you do not have to implement interfaces. Variables,
          parameters, and function return types are not explicitly typed.

          <p class="text">
            - A JavaScript identifier must start with a letter, underscore (_), or dollar sign ($);
            subsequent characters can also be digits (0-9). Because JavaScript is case sensitive,
            letters include the characters "A" through "Z" (uppercase) and the characters "a"

            names are Number_hits, temp99, and _name.

          - When you declare a variable outside of any function, it is called a global variable,
          because it is available to any other code in the current document. When you declare a
          variable within a function, it is called a local variable, because it is available only
          within that function.

            - JavaScript before ECMAScript 2015 does not have block statement scope; rather, a
            variable declared within a block is local to the function (or global scope) that the
            block resides within. For example the following code will log 5, because the scope of x
            is the function (or global context) within which x is declared, not the block, which in
            this case is an if statement.

            - Global variables are in fact properties of the global object. In web pages the global

        <div class="p-block">
          - Consequently, you can access global variables declared in one window or frame from
          another window or frame by specifying the window or frame name. For example, if a variable
          called phoneNumber is declared in a document, you can refer to this variable from an

            - You can create a read-only, named constant with the const keyword. The syntax of a
            constant identifier is the same as for a variable identifier: it must start with a
            letter, underscore or dollar sign and can contain alphabetic, numeric, or underscore

          <p class="text">
            - The scope rules for constants are the same as those for let block scope variables. If

          <p class="text">

            - Use the if statement to execute a statement if a logical condition is true. Use the
            optional else clause to execute a statement if the condition is false. An if statement
            looks as follows:
          </p>

          <div class="code-show">if (condition) { statement_1; } else { statement_2; }</div>

        <div class="p-block">
          <p class="text">
            - condition can be any expression that evaluates to true or false. See Boolean for an
            explanation of what evaluates to true and false. If condition evaluates to true,
            statement_1 is executed; otherwise, statement_2 is executed. statement_1 and statement_2
            can be any statement, including further nested if statements.
          </p>
          <p class="text">
            - You may also compound the statements using else if to have multiple conditions tested

          </p>

          <div class="code-show">
            if (condition_1) { statement_1; } else if (condition_2) {

          <p class="text">
            - In the case of multiple conditions only the first logical condition which evaluates to
            true will be executed. To execute multiple statements, group them within a block
            statement ({ ... }) . In general, it's good practice to always use block statements,
            especially when nesting if statements:
          </p>
          <div class="code-show">
            if (condition) { statement_1_runs_if_condition_is_true;

          <p class="text">
            - It is advisable to not use simple assignments in a conditional expression, because the
            assignment can be confused with equality when glancing over the code. For example, do
            not use the following code:
          </p>
          <div class="code-show">if (x = y) { /* statements here */ }</div>
          <br />
          <p class="text">
            - If you need to use an assignment in a conditional expression, a common practice is to
            put additional parentheses around the assignment. For example:
          </p>
          <div class="code-show">if ((x = y)) { /* statements here */ }</div>

          <p>
            - A while statement executes its statements as long as a specified condition evaluates
            to true. A while statement looks as follows:
          </p>
          <br />
          <div class="code-show">while (condition) statement</div>
          <p>
            - If the condition becomes false, statement within the loop stops executing and control
            passes to the statement following the loop.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            - The condition test occurs before statement in the loop is executed. If the condition
            returns true, statement is executed and the condition is tested again. If the condition
            returns false, execution stops and control is passed to the statement following while.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            - To execute multiple statements, use a block statement ({ ... }) to group those
            statements.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>- Example: The following while loop iterates as long as n is less than three:</p>
          <br />
          <div class="code-show">var n = 0; var x = 0; while (n < 3) { n++; x += n; }</div>
        </div>

        <div class="p-block">
          <p>
            - With each iteration, the loop increments n and adds that value to x. Therefore, x and
            n take on the following values:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>After the first pass: n = 1 and x = 1</li>
            <li>After the second pass: n = 2 and x = 3</li>
            <li>After the third pass: n = 3 and x = 6</li>
          </ul>
          <br />

            terminates.

            - A function definition (also called a function declaration, or function statement)
            consists of the function keyword, followed by:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>The name of the function.</li>
            <li>
              A list of arguments to the function, enclosed in parentheses and separated by commas.
            </li>
            <li>
              The JavaScript statements that define the function, enclosed in curly brackets, { }.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <br />
          <p>- For example, the following code defines a simple function named square:</p>
          <br />
          <div class="code-show">function square(number) { return number * number; }</div>
          <br />
          <p>
            - The function square takes one argument, called number. The function consists of one
            statement that says to return the argument of the function (that is, number) multiplied
            by itself. The return statement specifies the value returned by the function.
          </p>
          <br />
          <div class="code-show">return number * number;</div>
          <br />
          <p>
            - Primitive parameters (such as a number) are passed to functions by value; the value is
            passed to the function, but if the function changes the value of the parameter, this
            change is not reflected globally or in the calling function.
